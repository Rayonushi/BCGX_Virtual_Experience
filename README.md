BCGX is transforming the businesses of today through data science and analytics initiatives. Our goal is to help companies generate competitive advantage through these insights. 

Data Science is a large market of opportunity and expertise within BCG and when tackling a business problem there are typically 5 high level steps that we follow:
1.	Business understanding & problem framing: Understanding the context of the customer and the problem they are trying to solve with data.
2.	Exploratory data analysis:   Understanding the customers’ data and its statistical properties as well as preparing a dataset for further analysis.
3.	Feature engineering: Using business context and expertise to create new data that may provide useful signals in the prediction of outcomes.
4.	Modelling and Evaluation: Using your engineered dataset to model an outcome and generate predictions. Then, testing these predictions against the ground truth to see whether they are reliable.
5.	Insights & Recommendations: Turning the insights of this analysis into business decisions and recommendations.
